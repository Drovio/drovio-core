<h1>HTML Async Content Builder</h1>
<p>HTMLContent allows developers to build a customized HTML content and return it to the client using Drovio server report mechanism. HTMLContent is a "sibling" of JSONContent which means that it follows the same logic and the HTML generated is encapsulated in JSON.</p>
<p>An HTMLContent object can be built into any HTML element which can include pretty much everything. It provides a number of tools to the developer to build faster content and interaction listeners with less dependencies, acting as a facade.</p>
<p>The only exception is that the HTML content cannot include script tags to prevent code injection into html. This is forbidden by the report protocol mechanism. </p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Building a custom HTML content
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Content\HTMLContent;

// Create the object
$htmlContent = new HTMLContent();

// This is a UIObject, so we build
// The HTMLContent class is widely used for web views that also have an html file for static content
// Using the last parameter as TRUE, we can load the static HTML into the container element
$htmlContent->build($id = "container_id", $class = "container_class", $loadHTML = TRUE);


// We can create DOMElements using DOM or HTML and append them in the content
$div = DOM::create("div", "", "", "mainContainer");
$htmlContent->append($div);


// In case of static html, we can search using HTML and alter the content
$ctitle = HTML::select(".container_class .ctitle")->item(0);
HTML::innerHTML($ctitle, "This is the new title.");


// We can also use the entire UI library to create objects and append them in the container
$tabber = new tabControl();
$testTabber = $tabber->build()->get();
DOM::append($div, $testTabber);


// We can also use the HTMLContent as facade
$wl = $htmlContent->getWeblink($href = "https://redback.io", $content = "Redback Home", $target = "_self", $class = "");
DOM::append($div, $wl);


// After we have created the content, we send the report to the client
// We can define the holder where the content is going to be appended
// We can choose to replace all the inner html of the destination
return $htmlContent->getReport($holder = ".testContainer", $method = HTMLContent::REPLACE_METHOD);</pre>
