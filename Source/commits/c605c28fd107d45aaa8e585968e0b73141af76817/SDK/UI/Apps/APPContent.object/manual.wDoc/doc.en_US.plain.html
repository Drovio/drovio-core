<h1>Application HTML Async Content Builder</h1>
<p>APPContent extends HTMLContent and it is the main component for building application web views. In each application, when a view is being called, an APPContent object runs on the back in order to load all the necessary components and build the UI for the user.</p>
<p>Through this class, the application can deliver UI content or even action events. It also can create containers where another application view will be loaded sync or async.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Building an application view
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Apps\APPContent;

// Create the object
$appContent = new APPContent();

// See the action factory manual to learn about actions
$actionFactory = $appContent->getActionFactory();

// This is a UIObject, so we build
// We also load the static view html content
$appContent->build($id = "container_id", $class = "container_class", $loadHTML = TRUE);


// We can create DOMElements using DOM or HTML and append them in the content
$div = DOM::create("div", "", "", "mainContainer");
$htmlContent->append($div);


// In case of static html, we can search using HTML and alter the content
$ctitle = HTML::select(".container_class .ctitle")->item(0);
HTML::innerHTML($ctitle, "This is the new title.");


// After we have created the content, we send the report to the client
// Leave the holder empty to let the platform engine to choose
// We can choose to replace all the inner html of the destination
return $appContent->getReport($holder = "", $method = APPContent::REPLACE_METHOD);</pre>
</div>
<h2>Dynamic content in static html</h2>
<p>APPContent contains mechanisms that allow the developer to insert dynamic content inside the static html. Using data attributes, the content can include literals and resolve urls.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Literals</h3>
<p>We can set an element to load an application literal as child using the data-literal attribute as follows:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>data-literal='{"scope":"app_scope","name":"lbl_title"}'</pre>
</div>
<h3>Dynamic Urls</h3>
<p>We can set a weblink to dynamically assign an href attribute inside Redback:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>data-href='{"domain":"developer","page":"/docs/index.php"}'
	
The above will resolve into: https://developer.redback.io/docs/index.php</pre>
</div>
