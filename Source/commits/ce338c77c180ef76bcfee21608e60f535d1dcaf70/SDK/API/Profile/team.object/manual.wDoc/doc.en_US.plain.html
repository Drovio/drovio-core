<h1>Team profile manager</h1>
<p>This class provides access to the team profile information. It works only for the current active team.</p>
<p>This class is part of the Profile API allowing the developer to read and edit the team information. It also provides access to team public information.</p>
<h2>Validating current team</h2>
<p>A simple use of this interface is when we want to check if there is a logged in team for the system and act accordingly:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Use the class
use \API\Profile\team;

// Check if there is a valid team active, and whether the current account is member of this team
if (team::validate())
{
	// Get team id
	$teamID = team::getTeamID();
}
else
{
	// Do something else
}</pre>
</div>
<h2>Getting team information</h2>
<p>There are many times when we want to display team information to the user for listings or just display the team information:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Use the class
use \API\Profile\team;

// Get team name and display
$teamName = account::getTeamName();

// Get team profile image
$teamInfo = team::info();
if (isset($teamInfo['profile_image_url']))
{
	// Create an image div
	$img = DOM::create("img");
	DOM::attr($img, "src", $teamInfo['profile_image_url']);
	DOM::append($ico, $img);
}</pre>
</div>
