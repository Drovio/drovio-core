<h1>System Notification Object</h1>
<p>Notifications is one of the most important components in the system. We can see them pretty much everywhere there is interaction. On every form, error or success a notification of some kind will appear.</p>
<p>Developers are allowed to create a notification in four different types: success, error, warning and info. And they can customize the content as much as they want in order to have the desired outcome.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Create a simple success notification
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Presentation\notification;	
	
// Create the notification object
$ntf = new notification();

// This is a UIObject, so we build
// There is the chain pattern, so we get the DOMElement immediately
$notification = $ntf->build($type = notification::SUCCESS, $header = TRUE, $timeout = FALSE, $disposable = FALSE)->get();

// Append the notification to the container
DOM::append($container, $notification);</pre>
</div>
