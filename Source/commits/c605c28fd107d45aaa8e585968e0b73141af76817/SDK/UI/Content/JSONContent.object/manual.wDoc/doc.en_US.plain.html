<h1>JSON Async Content Builder</h1>
<p>JSONContent allows developers to build a customized json content and return it to the client using Redback server report mechanism.</p>
<p>A JSONContent can include any information and it is usually accompanied with an action, unless if the client called a script using the JSONServerReport.request() and there is a callback for the response.</p>
<p>The response follows the report mechanism of the platform and it is in JSON format.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Building a custom JSON content
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Content\JSONContent;

// Create the object
$jsonContent = new JSONContent();

// Create an array of information to return to the client
$info = array();
$info['userInfo'] = $userInfo;
$info['notification_settings'] = $notificationSettings;

// After we have created the array, we send the report to the client
// We leave the other parameters as is in order to work with the platform
// Those parameters can be used in combination with the Redback API Protocol to serve content to other apps
return $jsonContent->getReport($info, $allowOrigin = "", $withCredentials = TRUE, $key = "");</pre>
