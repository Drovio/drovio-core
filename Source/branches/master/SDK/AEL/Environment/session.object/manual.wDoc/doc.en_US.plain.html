<h1>Session manager</h1>
<p>This class extends the SDK session manager and acts like a facade to provide a easier interface to handle sessions. All namespaces are prefixed with the application identifier to avoid conflicts with other applications and the system. It's not a protection, it's a feature ;-)</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Every script that runs in the platform automatically starts the session at the beginning, so you don't have to start the session by yourself.</p>
<h2>Getting and setting values</h2>
<p>We separate session values in namespaces so that there are no conflicts. We use namespaces according to the type of value we want to store.</p>

importer::import("AEL", "Environment", "session");

use \AEL\Environment\session;

// Set a variable for a user
session::set($name = "username", $value = "john.doe", $namespace = "user_info");

// Get a variable for a user
$user_email = session::get($name = "username", $default = "", $namespace = "user_info");</pre>
