<h1>Interactive Switch Button</h1>
<p>Switch button is a simple Drovio control that provides functionality to turn on and off switches. It is interactive because instead of being part of a form, it is a form by itself which enables it to be independant and work separately from any form.</p>
<p>Build a switch button and append to a container:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Use the class
use \UI\Interactive\switchButton;

// It is a UIObject, so we have to initialize and build
$sb = new switchButton();
$switchButton = $sb->build($action = "/file/to/post.php", $active = FALSE, $name = "switch_name")->get();
DOM::append($container, $switchButton);


// We can also engage an application view
$sb = new switchButton();
$switchButton = $sb->build($action = "", $active = FALSE, $name = "switch_name")->engageApp($viewName = "testView")->get();
DOM::append($container, $switchButton);</pre>
</div>
<p>The above code will create a switch button form. Engaging with the button will cause the form to submit.</p>
<p>The switch button has 3 states, off, on and loading when it is waiting for server response after click/submit. The response should be an action to set the switch button status to on or off. Sample response:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Use the class
use \UI\Interactive\switchButton;

// Return a report status only for the switch button, set status to TRUE (on)
// Because of the bubbling events, the event will be connected with the submitted form
return switchButton::getReport($status = TRUE);


// We can use normal reports and add the switch button
// report action along with the rest of the report
$pageContent = new HTMLContent();

...

// Add the switch button report action
switchButton::addStatusReportAction($status = TRUE);

// Add other reports
$pageContent->addReportContent($content);

// Return the report
return $pageContent->getReport();</pre>
</div>
