<h1>Redback Register Dialog</h1>
<p>Developers can show a register dialog to their application (or page) to guest users in order to register. It is usually used with the login dialog. The register dialog allows the user to register in one step and refresh the page or redirect to the account profile page.</p>
<h2>How to use the dialog</h2>
<p>The dialog can be showed in two forms, embedded as a DOMElement inside a custom container or as a register popup dialog.</p>
<h3>Embedded register dialog</h3>
<p>The embedded register dialog allows the developer to customize the view layout in any way, but it has to calculate the size of the dialog in order not to loose information and cause a mess. This approach is not recommended because the dialog is quite large in dimensions and it will cover a big part of the application.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// The first example is the embedded dialog
// Use register dialog
use \UI\Login\registerDialog;

// So we have the container where we want to insert the dialog
$registerContainer = HTML::select(".registerContainer")->item(0);

// Create the dialog
$rgd = new registerDialog();

// The dialog follows the UIObjectPrototype, so we build
// We can set return url if needed
// We set the register type to be from application in order to refresh the page afterwards
$rgd->build($regtype = registerDialog::REG_TYPE_APP, $return_url = "");

// Since we want to embed the dialog,
// we get the DOMElement and we append it in the container
$dialog = $rgd->get();
HTML::append($registerContainer, $dialog);</pre>
</div>
<h3>Popup register dialog</h3>
<p>The popup register dialog allows the developer to create a global popup with the register dialog on top of everything. This approach could be better when you have limited space or you do not care about the looks. It is the simplest way.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// The second example is the popup dialog
// Use register dialog
use \UI\Login\registerDialog;

// Create the dialog
$rgd = new registerDialog();

// The dialog follows the UIObjectPrototype, so we build
// We can set return url if needed
// We set the register type to be from application in order to refresh the page afterwards
$rgd->build($regtype = registerDialog::REG_TYPE_APP, $return_url = "");

// This is supposed to be a view that will return the dialog,
// so we return the report
return $rgd->getReport();</pre>
</div>
