<h1>Form Error Notification Object</h1>
<p>An extension of the Form Notification Object is the error notification object. This object allows the developer to create a specific error notification that is equipped with an embedded list where errors can be appended. Examples:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Create a form error notification in response of a form post
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Forms\formReport\formErrorNotification;
	
// Create the notification object
$ntf = new formErrorNotification();

// This is a UIObject, so we build
// We do not have to get the DOMElement in this case, just build
// There are no parameters in the build process because they are predefined as error notification
$ntf->build();

// We add an error header
$header = $ntf->addHeader("Password error", $id = "");

// We can add multiple descriptions to the above header
// to describe why the error occurred
$ntf->addDescription($header, "The password is a required field.", $extra = "", $id = "");
$ntf->addDescription($header, "The password must include numbers, characters and dragon bones...", $extra = "", $id = "");

// After we finish building the notification, we return the report
// The report prevents the reset of the form (only passwords are being reset)
return $ntf->getReport();</pre>
</div>
