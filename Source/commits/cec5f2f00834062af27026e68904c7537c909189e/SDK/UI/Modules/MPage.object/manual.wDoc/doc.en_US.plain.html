<h1>Module HTML Async Content Builder</h1>
<p>A module view can contain content in two major categories: simple content that can be inserted pretty much everywhere and page content that is destined for entire pages, which could be the first responder when a page loads (and hosts other views). The MPage object is the object type that act as first responder to be loaded by the core page builder.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// Building a custom Module content
	
// Use the class
use \UI\Content\MPage;

// Create the object and give the module id to recognize literals and other stuff
$page = new MPage($moduleID);

// Get the action factory to create async actions
$actionFactory = $pageContent->getActionFactory();

// This is a UIObject, so we build, just like MContent
// We can also set the page title from here
$page->build($title = "Page Title", $class = "pageContainerClass", $loadHTML = TRUE);


// We can also interact with elements on the global toolbar
// The following will create an item that will be inserted on the toolbar when it reaches the client
// We can add collections using the getRCollection()
$page->addToolbarNavItem($id = "", $title = "Toolbar item", $class, $collection = NULL, $ribbonType = "float", $type = "obedient", $ico = TRUE);


// In case of static html, we can search using HTML and alter the content
$ctitle = HTML::select(".container_class .ctitle")->item(0);
HTML::innerHTML($ctitle, "This is the new title.");


// We can also use the entire UI library to create objects and append them in the container
$tabber = new tabControl();
$testTabber = $tabber->build()->get();
DOM::append($div, $testTabber);


// After we have created the content, we send the report to the client
// We can define the holder where the content is going to be appended
// We can choose to replace all the inner html of the destination
return $htmlContent->getReport($holder = ".testContainer", $method = HTMLContent::REPLACE_METHOD);</pre>
</div>
<h2>Dynamic content in static html</h2>
<p>Like MContent, MPage can contain literals and urls to be resolved at runtime.</p>
