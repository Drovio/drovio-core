<h1>Application platform manager</h1>
<p>Every application when is being executed has access to the platform application manager. This class allows developers mostly to import classes form the application source.</p>
<h3>PHP Example</h3>
<div class="code">
	<pre>// In application source object
	
// Import other application classes
application::import($package = "Main", $class = "test/testObject");

// Use the object
use \APP\Main\test\testObject;</pre>
</div>
<p>This is the master class from which APPContent gets access like loading views and managing loading depth of views.</p>
